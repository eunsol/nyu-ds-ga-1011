## NYU Data Science 
DSGA 1011 Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing

Instructor: [Eunsol Choi](https://eunsol.github.io)




## About

How can we empower machines to understand and generate human language, enabling them to summarize complex information, answer questions intelligently, or engage in meaningful conversation? This course dives into the principles and cutting-edge tools that make these capabilities possible. Students will explore three key paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP): supervised learning, the pretrain-then-finetune approach, and the latest advances in large language models, with a particular emphasis on representation learning techniques. The course combines theoretical foundations with practical applications. Students are expected to engage with research papers and gain hands-on experience through coding assignments and course projects.
